# Thomson's dotfiles 

## Intro 

This is a collection of dotfiles and scripts I found handy enough to keep. I
originally had these on Dropbox, but then realized I had no easy way to clone on
a remote box without installing Dropbox =(

This repo is heavily based off of [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman)'s
[dotfiles](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles), which used to be forked from
[Ryan Bates'](http://github.com/ryanb)
[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles). All I need now is someone to fork
this and continue the chainnnnnnnnnnnnnnn

Things I use: OS X, bash, Ruby, Rails, git, tmux, vim, rvm, fugitive, vim-r.

## Install

In three steps:

- `git clone git://github.com/itsthomson/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `rake install`
